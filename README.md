I am currently in my fourth year at [CCNU](https://www.ccnu.edu.cn/), a prestigious university situated in the beautiful city of **Wuhan**. 🚀

My academic focus is on **embedded software**, a field in which I have accumulated substantial experience through various embedded projects. My technical skills are grounded in programming languages such as **C**, and I have a solid understanding of platforms like **STM32** and **motor control** techniques.🌟

In addition to my passion for embedded systems, I have also developed an interest in **Java** backend development. My professional background includes work experience as a **product manager**, which has honed my ability to bridge the gap between technical and business aspects of software development. My practical experience is further enriched by an internship at a robotics company in **Shenzhen**, where I was tasked with developing the communication module. Presently, I am broadening my skills by interning at a software company in **Wuhan**, continuing to build my expertise in the tech industry.🌟
